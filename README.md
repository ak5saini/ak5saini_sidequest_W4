## Project Title

Side Quest Week 4: Data-Driven Pink Maze

---

## Description

This project is a small tile-based level built using arrays and loops in p5.js. The level layout is generated from data rather than being drawn manually, and a player square can move through the space using the keyboard. The design is intentionally simple and uses a pink colour palette to stay consistent with previous Side Quests while focusing on understanding how level data can control what appears on screen.

---

## Interaction Instructions

- The project starts automatically when the page loads.
- Use the arrow keys to move the player square around the level.
- Walls block movement, and the goal tile moves the player to the next level automatically.
- When the final level is completed, the game restarts from the first level.
